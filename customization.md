# 🎨 Theme customization

A proper documentation is coming but in the meantime you can checkout how the website [sspcloud.fr](https://www.sspcloud.fr) have extended GitLanding by:

* [Defining it's custom style](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/www.sspcloud.fr/blob/main/src/app/theme.ts)
* [Adding internationalisation](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/www.sspcloud.fr/blob/main/src/app/i18n/translations.ts)

You can also checkout [`onyxai-ui`](https://github.com/garronej/onyxia-ui), the design toolkit onto which Gitlanding is built.

Note also that you can import any [mui v5](https://mui.com) component in your GitLanding project. They will fit in nicely and blend in with your theme.&#x20;
